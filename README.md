A circular gallifreyan translator

circular gallifreyan is a beautiful language designed by [Loren Sherman at shermansplanet](http://www.shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan).  This is an html5 based transliterator that can turn text into circular gallifreyan and render to a canvas or a [C2S SVG context](http://gliffy.github.io/canvas2svg/).

This is nowhere near complete so expect many things to be broken.
